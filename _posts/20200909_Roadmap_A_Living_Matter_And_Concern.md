> The biggest mistake made by people "wanting" a roadmap is missing the the goal of a roadmap.
Most people think a roadmap is some kind of "must have" to build a plan, to build a budget, justify recruitments or show to the board to raise money.
This is true but if you build a roadmap "only" for this kind of goals, you are wrong! at least you miss other benefits of a roadmap.

# Let me take an example/illustration.
Say, with friends, you decide to go together on holidays to French Riviera next year : this is your goal or your "vision statement" :)
Whilst sharing some drinks, you start planning your holidays : you will travel as a group of 6 people, you want to spend 3 days in Nice, and if possible a couple of days in Monaco.
You decide that you will spend most of the nights in hotels and start looking at the options.
You agree for a cap budget and spend the rest of the night discussing about it.
Most of people know that if we spend with friends a single party discussing about it with no follow-up, this will be just a good idea, a nice party but with no tomorrow...

That's exactly what most people do when building roadmap, except it is usually painful, done in a rush but apart from the next board where you will share your plan, everything can be put to trash...
And guess what, next year or next quarter, you will have to redo the exercise : start with another Excel spreadsheet, ask Engineering ball-park estimates, etc

# Getting the habit and setting the expectation
Back to my example. If I'm serious with my friends, we really want to spend some good time together next year on French Riviera.
And, last year, we all share good memories about our last trip together visiting Ireland, so we want to do it again and we already know how we will do it.
In most companies I've been working for, defining a roadmap is a new thing or at least, nobody (left... :)) has done it last year so people do not share the good memories associated with "last holidays together last year".

If I forget to keep in mind the goal of my holidays - visiting French Riviera - then it becomes a hassle to decide and work on the details of the trip : the pleasure of spending some good time together gets swiped but the painful task of deciding how we gonna reach the riviera (train, car, bus, etc), syncing the agendas (we do not work in the same company...) or deciding if we all stay in the same hotel (some would prefer camping or just don't have budget for staying in 5-star hotels)
Well same for roadmap, usually people spend a lot of time on the hassle of working extra hours (ah, yes, same as planning holidays with friends, roadmaping is usually done during extra hours!!!! :)) on unreadable, Excel spreadsheets with two many columns and they do not share the destination.
Nobody has set the expectation : they just focus on the process and just want "shit done"
So as a group in a company, C-Level or whatever layer of decision/management has to define the target of the 12 months journey. This can be virtually anything but this has to be defined!
Some (working?) examples I can testify about:
- "Being the #1 in Customer Relationship"
- "Delivering a new module of our product"
To define these objectives, you can rely on techniques such as OKR Objectives and Key Results - [OKR on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR)

# Now you have a Final Destination :)
But you will have to decide some hops during your journey: when travelling to the French Riviera, you will need to decide, depending on your travel means, to make one-day stay in Lyon, a city your girlfriend dreams of visiting or decide about breaks on the motorway.
The nature of these hops is completely different :
- A one-day stay in Lyon is part of the holidays : you will want to discuss about it early because it's valuable to your girlfriend (but maybe not you or your other friends) and it has an impact on the amount of time you spend in your Final Destination together
- Having some breaks on the motorway : this is a given, it's way too early to discuss, you will decide when driving and this is something you will have to do (to avoid an accident on your way and thus ruin your holidays)
The point here is people tend to mix the nature of the elements they want to put on the roadmap : either they're getting confused by the different granularity / level of problem they put on the roadmap either they're getting confused by constraints that are maybe "enablers" but do not bring direct "value" to the roadmap.

As people usually make a tremendous effort to deliver a roadmap, they try to fix everything to have every detail as "perfect" as it can be.
Again this is wrong : the picture will be still blur at this stage... and the roadmap-letal mistake they are making is the following: once shared with the board, nobody cares about the roadmap anymore so the effort is a waste...
(By the way, developers gave wrong estimates in a rush session, nobody believed in the figures and everybody is relieved of forgetting about the roadmap D+1 so next time you will want to build a roadmap, it will be even worse...)

# Be prepared to work on your roadmap every month or even every week
Again back to my example : if this is the first time you travel with your group of friends, and if you're serious about travelling to French Riviera, guess what, you will spend some Saturday night parties or Sunday lunches talking about it, reading or sharing documentation, trying to agree on travel means.
Well it will be the center of your attention as a group of friends, not something done "because the Head of Product or the CEO wants it" (or even worse, because our customers/prospects need it)

So you will have to work on it again and again so that it becomes a habit you share as a group of people wanting to reach the same goal (and being paid that for)

> Well in the real life, we already started the journey and we still don't know where we go
Right, in most companies, nobody is waiting for me (or any nice and smart consultant from an even nicer and smarter consulting company) to work on a roadmap or a plan.
So how do you put that in place?
True, there is usually a lot of materials available: Excel spreadsheets testifying about past attempts or JIRA backlog of stories or features
This is the real thing: how do you leverage it?

1. Investing on it: decide that now, "roadmaping" cannot be a waste anymore so your Excel spreadsheet becomes a "Master Data" spreadsheet or buy licenses of JIRA or Productboard or Aha!
2. Telling everyone that as a group, you decide to be serious about it : every month there will be a Product Committee
3. Involving everyone : the developers will have to propose some ball-park estimates and you will make sure this info is saved and captured
4. Tracking changes : real life is not a simple as going to French Riviera, real life is dealing with hops like Lyon stay or deciding to move further than French Riviera and visit Italy. Real life is Sales people bringing deals and opportunities that can be grasped and changes the roadmap. Real life is changing your product and bringing innovation to differentiate on the market.

Tracking changes is key because it can be very frustrating to change directions and then your team gets lost : this does not mean you can't change the final destination, that means you want everybody to reach the final destination and understand why we go there.

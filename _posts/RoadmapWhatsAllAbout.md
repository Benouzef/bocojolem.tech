## Often I get questions on how to build a roadmap. What is the process?
Most of the people I work with solve problems with "tools" instead of asking themselves: what is the problem? what objective do I want to achieve?
Building a roadmap is not a "tooling" issue and not even a "building it" issue. 
It's merely a problem of drive and leadership: put someone in charge is the first step but that's only a starting point.

## A Roadmap : A "TODO" list at a strategic level
As simple as that, you can't imagine simpler: what do we want to achieve and when?
Then the devil is in the details because it's not a "static" view but a "dynamic" / living document that you have to deal with.
Usually, you put committments in your **"TODO"** list and then list *"candidates"* topics : similarly to how you would deal with your travel destinations you dream of...
The thing is sometimes you mix different "very big" things and you don't want to deal with details : you want to visit Mexico but you don't want to mess with choosing between Tikal or Teotihuacan when planning your "dreams"

## A Roadmap : balancing between visibility and stability
You need to share your vision about "where" you want to go : for example I want to visit Mexico, Canada and Vietnam within next year
However, when you enter "money time", you need to book your travel and commit dates and destination : if you want best prices, book 3 months ahead your tickets and stick to your plan of visiting Mexico next quarter.
In a roadmap, everything in a scope "less than 3 months" should be left "untouched" : you can't add or remove ANYTHING without paying a very high price of WASTE.
Everything "more than 3 months ahead of now" needs to be "candidate" and subject to changes : you need to make room for Sales opportunities or to "last minute" options.

## Arbitration : how to deal with it?
Even if you try to put things in the right "bucket" in terms of timescale, remains the question of priority or precedence. What should I do first and why?
Basically, if you do not travel alone, you need to evaluate the value of visiting one place instead of another : value will be the "benefit" you or your co-traveler - say your wife or kids - will get as a reward. This can be cultural, personal achievment, etc. And you need to balance the value with the associated "effort" : it can direct costs such as "money" or indirect ones such as "after visiting a museum with the kids, we will go to the beach"
In a company, you need to cherish common "benefits" or "values" as well as a common way of expressing "effort".
I definitely recommend this approach [WSJF](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/, "WSJF")

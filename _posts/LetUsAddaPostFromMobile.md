_Voil√†_ a post from Github on Mobile!!!

This is my achievment today :)
As simple as possible: I can write as if I was writing notes on my notebook.
Thanks to **Markdown, Next and Vercel**... 

From now on I need to put some images in my posts 
I will choose some beautiful (and free!) images from nature and landscapes all aronde the world
